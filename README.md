# Virtual Scroll Demo (Rick & Morty API)

This is a demo application for the [Angular CDK virtual scroll](https://material.angular.io/cdk/scrolling/overview).

It uses a public [Rick & Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/) for fetching character data. A big thank you to [Alex Fuhrmann](https://github.com/afuh) and [Talita](https://talitatraveler.com/) for creating this.

The demo application is available at [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/virtual-scroll-rm-demo?file=src%2Fapp%2Fcomponents%2Fcharacter-list%2Fcharacter-list.component.ts).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
